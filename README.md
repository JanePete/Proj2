# Proj2
This is my Project 2

Context for Design:
My movie card is particularly compatible and suited to movies styled and directed by Wes Anderson, but they are also able to display any type of movie and it's information. I have used a readable typeface and dark backgroud to enhance it's performance across the viewer's screen. This card could be seen on a website used to browse and buy movies. 



- Required card elements:
  - [ x ] Title
  - [ x ] Image
  - [ x ] _Movie Rating_
  - [ x ] _Movie Length_

## Best Practices
### HTML
- [ ] HTML is indented to enhance readability
- [ ] HTML is lowercase (valid exceptions: filenames)
- [ ] Double quotes are used around attributes (e.g., `href="https://mica.edu"`, `class="class-name"`)
- [ ] Self-closing elements do **not** include a closing slash
- [ ] Markup makes use of semantic elements and avoids `div`-itis
- [ ] A proper HTML5 `doctype` is set
- [ ] The HTML head includes a proper `title`
- [ ] Heading tags are used semantically, not simply for presentation
- [ ] `img` elements have helpful `alt` text (or a blank `alt=""` for decorative elements)
- [ ] Markup content is not presented in ALLCAPS for presentational purposes; this is achieved via the `text-transform` CSS property instead
- [ ] HTML is error free

### CSS
- [ ] CSS is lowercase
- [ ] Declarations within each ruleset are ordered alphabetically by property name
- [ ] A semicolon ends each declaration
- [ ] Comments are used to break up sections and explain your code
- [ ] `!important` is avoided overall and, when used, is justified via a comment
- [ ] `box-sizing` is declared
- [ ] All floats are properly cleared
- [ ] Selectors are either bare elements or classnames (IDs are avoided)
- [ ] Classnames are helpful and written kebab-style (i.e., using hyphens)
- [ ] CSS does **not** reiterate browser defaults
- [ ] CSS is not written in such a way that it is immediately overwritten by other declarations
- [ ] Color values are used logically and consistently (e.g., hex and hsl values aren't mixed)
- [ ] Units are used logically and consistently
- [ ] Zero measurements do **not** include units
- [ ] CSS is error free
